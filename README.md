# Food Fit

This is a personal project that demonstrates understanding of the <b>eMobilis Mobile Development Bootcamp</b> that I have just completed.

> ## Food Fit is an android app that uses [Spoonacular food API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) to provide recipes and nutrition information.

The app renders data in JSON(from the API) into card views placed in recycler views.

* Database - SQLite
* Software Development Life cycle

## About Food Fit
Users are authenticated via firebase, once logged in, the following actions can be performed:
*	Search for recipes via keywords
*	Look for special recipes via key words such as vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.
*   Random Recipes

The JSON response is parsed into card views in a scrollable recycler view showing cards of recipes
*	Each card shows the name of the recipe, picture, health score and the preparation time.
*	On clicking on a recipe in the recycle view, a new activity shows a little bit about the recipe: the ingredients(pictures) needed, rating and preparation time.
*	There is a button to select the recipe, which leads to a new activity displaying the actual recipe: ingredients,  cooking steps and serving suggestion and nutrition info.
*	Swiping from left displays a side bar, that shows the logged in user, and credits. There is also a log out button.
â€ƒ
The Home screen contains 3 bottom navigation buttons:
*	Home
*	Search Recipe
*	Random Recipe
