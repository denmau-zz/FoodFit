# Food Fit

This is a personal project that demonstrates understanding of the <b>eMobilis Mobile Development Bootcamp</b> that I have just completed.
This intensive bootcamp took 4 hours a day for 20 weekdays, totalling to 80 hours, including a 5 day incubation session.

> ## Food Fit is an android app that gives you access to 5,000+ recipes each with nutrition information.

The app renders data in JSON (from Spoonacular API) into card views placed in a recycler view.

## About Food Fit
Users are authenticated via firebase, once logged in, the following actions can be performed:
*	Look for special recipes via key words such as vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.
*   Search for recipe suggestion for breakfast, lunch and dinner
*   Random Recipes

The JSON response is parsed into card views in a scrollable recycler view showing cards of recipes
*	Each card shows the name and picture of the recipe
*	 a new activity shows a little bit about the recipe: the ingredients(pictures) needed, rating and preparation time.
*	On clicking on a recipe in the recipe card, a new activity displays the actual recipe: ingredients(with pictures),  cooking steps and nutrition info.
â€ƒ
The Home screen contains 3 bottom navigation buttons:
*	Home
*	Search Recipe
*	Account - signing out purposes and credits
